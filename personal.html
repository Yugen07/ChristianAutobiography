               <p style="text-align: center;color: black ; font-size: 25px;"> <i><b>I am Christian D. Amodia, and on April 16, 2002, I was born in the Lapu-Lapu District Hospital. My parents are Richard Amodia and Marites Amodia. Regrettably, they split up for two years before finding their own true love. Although it hurts terribly, we must go on living even though our families are broken.I have two sisters, Ni√±a Via and Fatima, as well as a brother, Richard Jr. To give you a brief overview of my educational background, I completed my elementary education at Agus Elementary School, my junior and senior high school at Marigondon National High School, and my tertiary education at the Lapu-Lapu City College, where I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Science and Industrial Technology program.</p>

               <p style="text-align: center;color: black ; font-size: 25px;"> <i><b>There have been many difficulties I've faced before starting college. When I graduate from senior high school, the pandemic was just getting started, and neither of my parents had jobs at the time. My father was a tricycle driver at the time, and he still is. This is why I won't be continuing my education in college. After the pandemic, bagyong odette presented itself as my next hurdle. Despite the fact that I was working at the time, my parents' constant bickering was having a negative impact on my life and that of my siblings and me. At times, I even joined in on the argument, which caused my mother and I to stop speaking.</p>

               <p style="text-align: center;color: black ; font-size: 25px;"> <i><b>I am a person who is shy in public and like to always be alone, but occasionally I am happy with my friends. I know that I am kind to everyone.  Online gaming, watching various drama series, and hanging out with friends are some of my pastimes. As an introvert, it can be challenging to interact with people outside of the classroom, but as I start college, I'm learning how to be more outgoing. We all know that the first thing we must do as adults is to step outside of our comfort zones and recognize that there will always be problems in life that we must face and overcome.Everybody has life goals, but it's up to each of us to decide how to overcome challenges that will help us become stronger.</p>
